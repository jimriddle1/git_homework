don't be afraid to speak up when you think you have the answer
be ok with not getting concepts immediately.  this will happen a lot, and it's something you haven't experienced in about a decade
be more prepared for the rest of the lessons, including eating prior and or setting up the work station
find clarity on my current position to better plan my transition from work to school
Aether was super supportive and fun when we were doing the git driver / navigator exercise.  reminded me that this can and should be fun, and it's never too late to add some levity to learning
these are some of my new thoughts - need some more practice on adding and committing.  do i need to do that every time?
